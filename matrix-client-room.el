;;;; Macros

(cl-defmacro matrix-client-defevent (type docstring &key object-slots event-keys content-keys let body)
  "Define a method on `matrix-room' to handle Matrix events of TYPE.

TYPE should be a symbol representing the event type,
e.g. `m.room.message'.

DOCSTRING should be a docstring for the method.

OBJECT-SLOTS should be a list of lists, each in the form (OBJECT
SLOT ...), which will be turned into a `with-slots*' form
surrounding the following `pcase-let*' and BODY.  (This form
seems more natural than the (SLOTS OBJECT) form used by
`with-slots'.)

The following are bound in order in `pcase-let*':

EVENT-KEYS should be a list of symbols in the EVENT alist which
are bound with `pcase-let*' around the body.  These keys are
automatically bound: `content', `event_id', `sender',
`origin_server_ts', `type', and `unsigned'.

CONTENT-KEYS should be a list of symbols in the EVENTs `content'
key, which are bound in the `pcase-let*' around the body.

LET should be a varlist which is bound in the `pcase-let*' around
the body.

BODY will finally be evaluated in the context of these slots and
variables.

It is hoped that using this macro is easier than defining a large
method without it."
